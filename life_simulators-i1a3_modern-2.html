                <p>
                    In the 1981 post-structuralist book <italic>Simulacra and Simulation</italic>, Jean Baudrillard puts
                    forward his theory that signs have come to constitute and replace reality. The term 'simulacra'
                    (plural: simulacrum) refers to representations and copies that have either come to replace reality
                    itself, or never had originals. 'Simulation' simply refers to something which emulates real life.
                    Baudrillard proposes his theory of the four stages of simulacra which mark a degradation of
                    reality:</p>
                <p>1 It is the reflection of a basic reality.</p>
                <p>2 It masks and perverts a basic
                    reality.</p>
                <p>3 It masks the absence of a basic reality.</p>
                <p>4 It bears no relation to any
                    reality whatever: it is its own pure simulacrum.</p>
                <p>The first two stages are easily identifiable
                    in the real world - they are exemplified by photographs and simple photoshop jobs. The third and
                    fourth stages are harder to identify, as they stray further from reality. Baudrillard observes that
                    the fourth stage of pure simulacrum sets the stage for the hyperreal - where reality and simulation
                    cannot be distinguished from one another. In order to demonstrate this, Baudrillard gives the
                    example of Disneyland. He writes:</p>
                <p>Disneyland is a perfect model of all the entangled orders
                    of simulation. To begin with it is a play of illusions and phantasms: pirates, the frontier, future
                    world, etc. This imaginary world is supposed to be what makes the operation successful. But, what
                    draws the crowds is undoubtedly much more the social microcosm, the miniaturized and religious
                    revelling in real America, in its delights and drawbacks.</p>
                <p>Disneyland embodies the levels of
                    simulacra in every aspect of its existence. From the forced perspective of Main Street to the
                    costumed adults on parade floats, it only seems right to denote the theme park as its own land.
                    Disneyland is quintessentially American, a consumer haven that lacks real substance. It is more
                    American than America itself, a simple utopia branded as the 'happiest place on Earth'. The unspoken
                    agreement to lean into the illusion and pretend that Disneyland differs from the rest of the world
                    holds the entire corporation together. Once enveloped in this fourth order simulacra, the real and
                    simulation become one and the same. Real discomforts and problems become part of Disney's charm,
                    further entrancing visitors. Nearly anything can be forgiven when under the spell of Disney magic.
                </p>
                <p>The term "Disney adult" was coined in the early 2020s to describe millennial fans of
                    Disneyland who base their entire identity off of the Disney universe. As an article by Rolling Stone
                    jokes, "a Disney adult is someone who lives and breathes the brand, buying limited-edition mouse
                    ears and popcorn buckets and branded fitness trackers the moment they drop, constantly posting free
                    advertisements for the park in the form of Cinderella's Castle and Purple Wall selfies." Disney is
                    more than just an interest for this group, it's a lifestyle. Many spend thousands of dollars on each
                    trip to the theme parks, and thousands more on seasonal merchandise drops. Disney adults have
                    garnered much criticism online for having childish interests and spending their money irresponsibly
                    - yet in 1981 Baudrillard suggested that Disneyland deliberately targets adults. He wrote, "it is
                    meant to be an infantile world, in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the
                    "real" world, and to conceal the fact that real childishness is everywhere, particularly among those
                    adults who go there to act the child in order to foster illusions of their real childishness."
                    Disneyland is touted by Disney adults as a way to keep one's inner child alive, but if anything it
                    exists to legitimize the concept of adulthood. It suggests that adults exist, if not in these
                    cartoons, then in the 'real' world. Adulthood is written into the code of society, a natural
                    destination for every person. It is more than the mere act of working a 9-5 and paying one's own
                    bills, it's the acceptance of the social structure as fact and unquestioned obedience to authority.
                    And yet, something keeps most people from fully embracing adulthood. They are able to parse reality
                    and simulation from one another, but strive to become 'adults'. Disneyland preserves the idea that
                    the adult exists as the pinnacle of capitalist and imperialist interests. In the Disney corporation,
                    'adults' only exist to fiscally support the commercial interests of 'children'. They work and work
                    until they can take a vacation and visit "the happiest place on Earth", where they can revert back
                    to children, oblivious to the fact that they are pursuing an impossible ideal. They will never be
                    adults.</p>
                <p>Similarly, people are attracted to digital life simulators. Simulators allow
                    us to feel that there is merit behind rules and social conventions, cementing the systems in
                    reality. It seems that the attraction of modern simulators is best analyzed using a combination of
                    philosophical theories. French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan argues that fantasy is closer to reality
                    than to dreams: "What does it mean, more precisely, to say that ideological fantasy structures
                    reality itself? Let us explain by starting from the fundamental Lacanian thesis that in the
                    opposition between dream and reality, fantasy is on the side of reality: it is, as Lacan once said,
                    the support that gives consistency to what we call 'reality' (Zizek 44)."
                </p>
                <p>According to Zizek, it's not that we don't know we're in a simulation; it's that we
                    know but pretend not to. There appears to be no way out of this reality we've created, leading us
                    toward smaller, easily controlled simulations such as virtual life simulators. With over 200 million
                    copies sold worldwide, the prime example has to be the Sims franchise. Like Disney, the Sims has a
                    cult following of chronically-online individuals. The Sims has a simple concept and gameplay,
                    something that has only seemed to help boost its appeal to players. According to The Sims 4 game
                    description, the franchise invites players to "play with life and discover the possibilities.
                    Unleash your imagination and create a world of Sims that's wholly unique. Explore and customize
                    every detail from Sims to homes-and much more." While playing The Sims, the possibilities seem
                    endless - but are they? Lacan would argue that this is just another instance of ideological fantasy.
                    Players have choices, but the options are pre-determined. The laws of physics can be challenged, but
                    societal conventions still dictate what is allowed and what isn't. Players are made to believe that
                    they're in control of the game, yet their every move has already been predicted by the gamemakers.
                    Even the game's description looks to influence our perception of control; it claims that players are
                    able to "customize every detail". The appeal of The Sims reaches beyond the game and peaks in the
                    so-called 'real world'. Its existence comforts us, a contained simulation characterized by the
                    illusions of choice and control. Baudrillard would say that The Sims is just another tool used to
                    control the minds of players. It simultaneously reinforces the ideologies of our simulation whilst
                    giving players reason to believe in a reality. Further, its cultural impact is simply the worship of
                    simulacra.</p>
                <p>What interests me most about modern-day simulacra is the performance of it
                    all. It's not just the private consumption of Disney movies or playing of The Sims, but the Disney
                    influencers and Twitch livestreams of gameplay. It's the extensive creation of content based on the
                    consumption of commercial products and the concurrent curation of an online persona for social
                    media. On top of this exists thousands of people whose content is solely based on consuming and
                    reacting to another creator's content. The web is endless. We have entered the hyperreal.
