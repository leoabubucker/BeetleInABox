                <p>The relationship between citizen and State is not one-sided. Individuals are shaped by the social and
                    political systems that they live in. Our society plays a large part in our desires, fears, and
                    conception of ourselves. Analogously, political systems seek to govern individuals. Therefore, in
                    seeking to justify a political system, a political philosophy must rely on a conception of human
                    nature.
                </p>
                <p>The political system of the United States is liberal democracy. In fact, the United States was the
                    first nation founded with an explicitly liberal government. Liberalism is a political philosophy
                    that places individual rights and freedom above all else. Since the end of World War II, liberalism
                    has been the dominant political philosophy of Western nations. Recently, however, liberalism in the
                    United States and across the globe has been failing. We are experiencing widespread discontent with
                    public institutions and the rise of populism and authoritarianism. In this context, liberalism can
                    be questioned and criticized from many directions. However, given that much of the backlash to
                    liberalism is driven by citizens who feel unseen and disrespected, I believe that it is especially
                    important to ask: does liberalism understand people? Is liberalism based on a robust, realistic
                    conception of human nature? And if not, can it justify itself while accommodating such a conception?
                </p>
                <p>One way to approach these questions is empirically, by studying modern liberal democracies. However,
                    if we are interested in the viability of liberalism itself, instead of a particular nation's system
                    of government, these questions should be explored through philosophy. The liberal-communitarian
                    debate, which emerged in the 1980s, sheds light on liberalism's conception of human nature. In 1971,
                    John Rawls published <italic>A Theory of Justice</italic>, which argues for a particular flavor of
                    liberalism. <italic>A Theory of Justice</italic> "was said to revive political philosophy when it
                    was published" (), and while the book was a bold departure from the view preceding it, today its
                    ideas have become deeply held. Rawls is held up as the "torchbearer" of modern liberalism (Campbell,
                    ). In 1982, Michael Sandel published <italic>Liberalism and The Limits of Justice</italic>, which
                    criticizes liberalism on the grounds that it offers an inadequate and wrong conception of human
                    nature. Diving into Rawls' work and Sandel's rebuttal will give us a greater understanding of
                    liberalism's appeal and its relationship with human nature and the identities of the individuals
                    that it seeks to govern.
                </p>
                <bold>Rawls
                </bold>
                <p>"Justice is the first virtue of social institutions," is how Rawls begins <italic>A Theory of Justice
                    </italic> (). Justice is more than just another value to Rawls. It is the yardstick on which other
                    values are measured, the "value of values" (Sandel,). While utilitarianism-the dominant ethical
                    system at the time of Rawls' writing-sees justice as instrumentally important to ensure happiness
                    and well-being, Rawls sees justice as an end in itself. As a result, ensuring a just society is more
                    important than any other concerns. Rawls writes: "Each person possesses an inviolability founded on
                    justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override" (#). The reasons that Rawls
                    believes in the primacy of justice are complex, but two components are 1) he sees justice as
                    universal and 2) he asserts that all people share a core idea of justice, namely, forbidding
                    arbitrary distinctions between persons.
                </p>
                <p>What is justice to Rawls? First, he restricts his theory of justice to social justice. The justice
                    that Rawls discusses has as its subject the basic structure of society, which is the way that major
                    social institutions-not just the government-distribute fundamental rights and duties and determine
                    the division of advantages that come from social cooperation. Rawls sees society as characterized by
                    cooperation and conflict. Justice is necessary because people in a society cooperate to their mutual
                    benefit but are also inherently in a state of conflict over their share of those benefits. He calls
                    this one of the circumstances of justice.
                </p>
                <p>After asserting the primacy of justice and describing its role (distributing rights and benefits),
                    Rawls moves to describing a just society. To determine the principles that govern a just society,
                    Rawls employs the original position, an ingenious thought experiment that has become an inseparable
                    part of his philosophy.
                </p>
                <p>The original position imagines a group of people deciding together on the principles that will govern
                    their society. The participants have equal power in the negotiation, and they are assumed to be
                    rational and mutually disinterested (primarily focused on their own ends). What is more significant,
                    however, is what the participants do not have. They do not know their own social status or class
                    position, or the distribution of their natural assets, such as intelligence, strength, or work
                    ethic. No one even knows their own preferences, interests, or conception of the good. To make a
                    decision possible, the participants get a general understanding of government, the economy, and
                    human psychology, but any facts that would allow participants to distinguish themselves from others
                    are hidden by what Rawls calls the veil of ignorance.
                </p>
                <p>Why is so much forbidden from our hypothetical decision makers? Rawls writes, "Somehow we must
                    nullify the effects of specific contingencies which put men at odds and tempt them to exploit social
                    and natural circumstances to their own advantage" (Theory, 118). Rawls believes that the veil of
                    ignorance ensures fairness. Without it, people will push for principles that favor their particular
                    condition. A wealthy man, for example, could advocate for no wealth redistribution-not because he
                    thinks it is just, but to benefit himself.
                </p>
                <p>Rawls asserts that the principles agreed to in the original position-which he calls the principles of
                    justice-are the correct principles for a just society. Since the original position is fair, the
                    agreements made in the position will be fair too. Thus, when social institutions satisfy the
                    principles of justice, people can say that they are "cooperating on terms to which they would agree"
                    if their relations with each other were fair. This is the beauty of the original position. In this
                    way, "a society satisfying the principles of justice as fairness comes as close as a society can to
                    being a voluntary scheme" (12). This provides political legitimacy: In a society governed by the
                    principles agreed to in the original position, everyone can be rightfully obligated to abide by the
                    law. Here, Rawls' thought aligns with social contract theory, such as John Locke's <italic>Second
                        Treatise of Government</italic>. However, where Locke's initial situation is a "state of
                    nature", Rawls' is the original position.
                </p>
                <p>After Rawls establishes that the principles of justice are the ones agreed to in the original
                    position, he moves to a second question: What principles would in fact be adopted by the equal,
                    free, and veiled participants?
                </p>
                <p>The participants are rational and focused on their own well-being. They would understand that they
                    only have one life and must abide by the principles even in the worst possibilities, so they would
                    "ensure themselves against the worst eventualities" (,). Therefore, Rawls reasons, the participants
                    would reject the principle of utility, which requires an individual to sacrifice his well-being when
                    it benefits others more than it hurts him. Instead, the participants would agree to two principles.
                    First (and foremost), "each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive scheme of equal
                    basic liberties compatible with a similar scheme of liberties for others." Second, "social and
                    economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both (a) reasonably expected to be to
                    everyone's advantage, and (b) attached to positions and offices open to all" (53).
                </p>
                <p>The second principle, called the Difference Principle, is more controversial than the first. It
                    entails that any social or economic inequality is acceptable only if it benefits the least
                    advantaged member of society. For example, a businessman could only make more money than others-in
                    fact the position of a businessman could only exist-if the poorest person was benefited by the
                    businessman having more money and power. The Difference Principle has radical implications, but
                    through the lens of the original position, it makes sense. Every participant has to consider the
                    possibility that they will be the least advantaged member of society (no one knows that they are
                    not). No participant would agree to others having more than them, unless they know that they will
                    benefit from it.
                </p>
                <bold>Kant
                </bold>
                <p>In <italic>Liberalism and The Limits of Justice</italic>, Sandel's criticism begins by framing Rawls'
                    relationship to Kant. Much of Rawls' philosophy stems from Kant: he writes "the theory of justice
                    tries to present a natural procedural rendering of Kant's conception of the kingdom of ends, and of
                    the notions of autonomy and the categorical imperative" (Theory, 264).
                </p>
                <p>Kant believed that we know nothing from our passively received representations. Our experience is
                    created by our innate mental rules for combining representations, which exist independently and
                    prior to those representations. He believed that our self-consciousness, the awareness that the
                    different mental states that stream through our consciousness are experienced by one unified person,
                    is an a priori judgement, which means that it is known independent of experience. Therefore, the
                    thinking subject is unable to be reached empirically, by introspection, and must be presupposed. To
                    Kant, the agent is prior to any experience.
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, Kant differentiated two worlds: the phenomenal and the noumenal. The phenomenal world
                    is the world as it appears to us. It consists of the appearances of things. The noumenal world, on
                    the other hand, consists of things in themselves. However, it exists independently of our experience
                    and is imperceptible to us. Kant believes that we are rational agents, characterized by autonomy and
                    absolute moral worth. Crucially, this autonomy exists in the noumenal realm. Physically and
                    phenomenally, we are determined, but we must conceive of ourselves as being free. We are
                    transcendentally or noumenally free.
                </p>
                <p>This metaphysical picture informs Kant's political philosophy. His political ideal is the kingdom of
                    ends. The kingdom of ends exists in the noumenal realm. In it, rational beings exist equally,
                    abiding by moral law and treating each other as ends, instead of means. We are to act "as if we are
                    members of the kingdom of ends" (). In this way, Kant argues, we are committed to a liberal social
                    order that values freedom and equality. This obligation is not rooted in empirical considerations
                    such as happiness or well-being. Rather, we must obey moral law because it is in our nature as
                    rational beings.
                </p>
                <bold>Sandel
                </bold>
                <p>Rawls shares many of Kant's conclusions. Both believe in the priority of the right over the good and
                    deontology, the view that principles of justice should not presuppose any ends or determinate
                    conception of the good. However, given his metaphysics, Kant's moral philosophy applies to humans
                    only insofar as we are disembodied rational agents in the noumenal realm. This is unacceptable for
                    Rawls and most other political philosophers. Rawls seeks to reach universal, Kantian principles of
                    justice that apply to human beings in our actual, empirical circumstances. According to Sandel,
                    "Rawls rejects Kant's metaphysics, but believes he can preserve their moral force" (Liberalism, 24).
                </p>
                <p>Rawls faces a tricky challenge: If his principles are derived from current social values, they will
                    be contingent, not universal. However, if they are entirely divorced from current values and human
                    nature, they will be groundless. Sandel describes Rawls as bringing together the contradicting
                    Humean and Kantian conceptions of justice. Hume believed that justice is the product of human
                    conventions, and therefore not universal. Rawls also believes that justice is the product of human
                    convention, specifically the fact that societies are in conflict over the distribution of the
                    benefits of cooperation, but he wants to advance universal principles of justice. His tool to bridge
                    this gap is the original position.
                </p>
                <p>Sandel writes, "the description of the original position interprets the point of view of noumenal
                    selves" (Liberalism, 255). Like the participants in the original position, the noumenal self is
                    rational and fair, being stripped from contingent and therefore morally irrelevant social and
                    natural influences. However, the original position does not have to "rely on a noumenal realm or on
                    the notion of a transcendent subject wholly beyond experience" (Liberalism, 39). Instead, the
                    circumstances of justice are baked into the original position: the participants are mutually
                    disinterested, want to maximize their own benefits, and are in conflict over the distribution of
                    benefits.
                </p>
                <p>A key contention in Sandel's criticism of Rawls is that Rawls' argument necessarily posits an account
                    of the individual subject of justice. "Implicit in Rawls' theory of justice is a conception of the
                    moral subject," Sandel claims (49). This makes sense. A political philosophy must rely on a
                    conception of human nature. However, Sandel also claims that Rawls' conception of the moral subject
                    is reflected in the participants of the original position. This is not so clear. Rawls clearly
                    states that, "we must keep in mind that the parties to the original position are theoretically
                    defined individuals" and that "the motivation of the persons in the original position must not be
                    confused with the motivation of persons in everyday life who accept the principles that would be
                    chosen" (147-148).
                </p>
                <p>Why does Sandel claim that it is appropriate to level a criticism at Rawls through the subjects in
                    the original position? His answer points to the unique status of the original position as an
                    argument. Rawls describes the original position as a "reflexive equilibrium" (). It puts forth
                    claims about both principles of justice and human nature. Therefore, it must be evaluated from two
                    sides: 1) our intuitions about the correct principles of justice and 2) our intuitions about the
                    moral subject. While the people in the original position need not be exactly like us, they must have
                    some connection to us. Otherwise, why would the decision of imaginary people in a hypothetical
                    situation be relevant to us? Their decision is binding to us because they are meant to have all
                    human qualities that are necessary for making moral decisions. The conditions of the original
                    position come from "the nature of the moral subject as we understand it, which is to say by the
                    constitutive understanding we have of ourselves" (Liberalism, 48). Therefore, Sandel contends, "we
                    must be prepared to live with the vision contained in the original position" ().
                </p>
                <p>What, then, is the vision of human nature contained in the original position? Based on the original
                    position, we must be somewhat rational and mutually disinterested, although Rawls does not believe
                    that humans are perfectly rational or individualistic. Crucially, the individuals in the original
                    position are separated from their ends. They do not know what they believe or desire.
                </p>
                <p>For Rawls, this is possible because "the self is prior to the ends that are affirmed by it" (Theory,
                    560). Rawls conceives the relationship between the self and its ends as one of possession, where the
                    self is "distanced from its ends without being detached all together" (Liberalism, 55). The self
                    being prior to the ends is seen in Rawls' moral view that conceptions of the good are not relevant
                    to justice. It is also seen, Sandel alleges, in his metaphysical view that the self exists
                    independently from its ends.
                </p>
                <p>After arguing that <italic>A Theory of Justice</italic> entails a particular account of human nature,
                    Sandel attacks this account. Rawls claims that the conditions of the original position track with
                    our commonly shared intuitions about the moral subject. Sandel disagrees, writing that "Rawls'
                    conception of the person can neither support his theory of justice nor plausibly account for our
                    capacities for agency and self-reflection." "We cannot coherently regard ourselves as the sort of
                    beings the deontological ethic requires us to be" (65).
                </p>
                <p>Sandel attacks Rawls' conception of the self by arguing that the Rawlsian self cannot form
                    constitutive attachments. The Rawlsian self is "antecedently individuated." Its identity is "fixed
                    prior to experience." This subject is not constituted by his character traits, interpersonal
                    relationships, and desires; he possesses these things. Possession means, Sandel writes, that "If I
                    lose a thing I possess, I am still the same I" (). The Difference Principle acutely exposes this
                    feature of Rawls' philosophy. Rawls believes that the benefits that one earns from their own natural
                    assets, such as intelligence, courage, and work ethic, belong to society. This appears as if it
                    conflicts with Kant's imperative by using people as means rather than ends. To Rawls, however,
                    stripping a person from the fruits of their assets does not use them as a means because a person's
                    natural assets are not an integral part of their self.
                </p>
                <p>The Rawlsian subject always stands at a distance from his interests and exists independently from his
                    values. Therefore, no commitment could grip him so deeply that he couldn't exist as himself without
                    it. According to Sandel, the Rawlsian conception of the self "rules out the possibility of any
                    attachment (or obsession) able to reach beyond our values and sentiments to engage our identity
                    itself" (). The Rawlsian self, Sandel claims, is "a person wholly without character, without moral
                    depth" (). Human beings are capable of self-reflection, in which we investigate who we really are by
                    probing at our inner desires and formative relationships. This requires that our inner self be
                    "constituted in part by our central aspirations and attachments."
                </p>
                <p>As a communitarian, Sandel gives special attention to community, one of the many attachments that, in
                    Rawls' view, cannot be constitutive towards our identity. Sandel believes that our community, which
                    provides us with shared vocabulary, practices, and values, shapes our identity. "We have allegiances
                    as members of this family, community, nation," he writes (). "We are sons or daughters of that
                    revolution and citizens of that republic" (). Liberal justice assumes that individuals are
                    unfamiliar. Since we are "encumbered in part by a history" that we share with others, Sandel
                    asserts, we have an obligation towards some people that goes beyond what justice requires or even
                    permits.
                </p>
                <p>Sandel has painted Rawls' subject as abstract, disencumbered, and unrealistic: the Kantian moral self
                    that Rawls set out to avoid. The participants of the original position cannot be thought of as
                    resembling people at all. Since they are deprived of all distinguishing characteristics, they are
                    identical (Liberalism, 113). The supposed plurality of individuals melts into an indistinguishable
                    one. This is a stark contrast with liberalism's purported tolerance of diversity, an essential part
                    of its appeal. Moreover, the participants in the original position do not in fact decide on the
                    principles of justice. Making an informed decision requires reflecting on our values and character
                    traits. Instead, the participants of the original position determine the principles of justice that
                    are imposed by the conditions of the thought experiment. Rawls' principles of justice are not based
                    on the consent of multiple parties, which is required for a contract or agreement. Therefore, his
                    argument does not fit into the contractarian tradition. According to Sandel, Rawls' lacking
                    conception of the self leaves his theory of justice unjustified.
                </p>
                <bold>Conclusion
                </bold>
                <p>Sandel's criticism of <italic>A Theory of Justice</italic> is from a communitarian perspective,
                    although he disavows that label. He argues that in assuming that the self is antecedently
                    individuated, Rawls-who claims to rule out no conceptions of the good-rules out communitarian ones.
                    Liberalism is too individualistic. While community can be an aim of some of the subjects of a
                    liberal society, the society itself can never be a community. In fact, Rawls rules out any ends
                    whose adoption could engage with or transform the identity of the self.
                </p>
                <p>However, the complaint that liberalism relies on an unrealistic conception of the self is not an
                    exclusively communitarian concern. Libertarian Robert Nozick, rebutting Rawls' Difference Principle
                    in <italic>Anarchy, State, and Utopia</italic>, writes that Rawls, "presses very hard on the
                    distinction between men and their talents, assets, abilities and special traits" (Liberalism, 78).
                    He agrees with Sandel: Rawls' subject, detached from its abilities and character traits, resembles
                    the Kantian disencumbered self (Liberalism, 79).
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, liberalism is not the only political philosophy that has been criticized for not
                    understanding people. Rawls himself criticized utilitarianism on similar grounds, writing that
                    "utilitarianism extends to society the principle of choice for one man ... To do this is not to take
                    seriously the plurality and distinctness of individuals." This argument is taken up by Bernard
                    Williams in <italic>A Critique of Utilitarianism</italic>. Williams asserts that utilitarianism "can
                    make only the most superficial sense of human desire and action at all." As a type of
                    consequentialism, utilitarianism endorses negative responsibility. You are just as responsible for
                    killing someone as you are for failing to prevent a murder (). Classically, utilitarianism also
                    ignores equity. In its unyielding focus on maximizing happiness across all agents, only the total
                    happiness matters, not its distribution-even if some agents are left with none (). Both of these
                    points show that utilitarianism abstracts from the identity of individual moral agents.
                </p>
                <p>The liberal-communitarian debate and the criticism of utilitarianism show that the identity of its
                    citizens is something that a political system needs to consider. As political philosophers build
                    empires in the sky, they must not forget to ground them in human nature. Our identities are
                    constituted by-and inconceivable independent of-our values, community, and character traits. The
                    State needs to speak to, attempt to provide, or engage with our deep-seated allegiances and
                    conceptions of the good, not ignore them. Rawlsian liberalism, in taking people to be detached from
                    their identities, is flawed.
                </p>
                <p>It is important to note that <italic>A Theory of Justice</italic> is not the end of Rawls' political
                    thought and Rawls' liberalism is not the only form of liberalism. Nevertheless, even though the
                    United States is not the well-ordered society that Rawls envisioned, <italic>Liberalism and the
                        Limits of Justice</italic> resonates intensely today. Liberalism, Sandel asserts, "rules out the
                    possibility of a public life in which, for good or ill, the identity as well as the interests of the
                    participants could be at stake." It "overlooks the danger that when politics goes badly, not only
                    disappointments but dislocations are likely to result" (183). In the Trump era of American politics,
                    it is clear that identity is at stake. Liberalism has attempted to put the self beyond that reach of
                    politics, but this is not possible. In his conclusion, Sandel writes that the citizens of the
                    deontological republic are "strangers" (183) and that the Rawlsian self "is less liberated than
                    disempowered" (177). Today, despite unprecedented, world-wide communication, we are strangers to our
                    neighbors. Despite unprecedented freedom, we feel less liberated than disempowered. Liberalism has
                    broken its promises, and its flawed understanding of human nature is a compelling explanation for
                    why.
