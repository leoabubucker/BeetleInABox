                <p>
                    Each day of our lives, we are required to weigh the good and bad of our choices and make the
                    decision we choose as best. Oftentimes, we don’t judge the morality of our actions based on any
                    particular framework, but rather use our intuitive judgements to the best of our ability. The task
                    of moral philosophers is to create a framework that aligns with our intuitive judgements that
                    allows us to retrospectively or proactively gauge the morality of a particular action. Several of
                    these moral frameworks focus on the balance of good/bad in the result of a particular action to
                    determine moral praiseworthy or blameworthiness of the action, a view known as consequentialism.
                    While this may seem like a comprehensive system at first glance, it fails to account for another
                    facet of actions that we intuitively know holds moral weight: intentions. We would not hold the
                    person who engages in a morally blameworthy action while under threat of physical harm to the same
                    standard as someone who committed an identical action completely of their own volition, even though
                    the outcomes are the same. The lesson when it comes to our intuitive perceptions of moral appraisal
                    is simple; intention matters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The importance of intention is reflected in a formula for moral judgement known as the Doctrine of
                    Double Effect (DDE). According to the Doctrine of Double Effect, an action that brings harm to a
                    person is permissible as long as that harm is an unintended consequence of bringing about a greater
                    good, not a means to an end . As long as the goal of the action is good and the harm brought about
                    is an unfortunate side effect, a harmful action may still be permissible. The DDE allows for that
                    an actor to act conscionably whilst being certain that harm will result from their action. In
                    essence,
                    the DDE makes a distinction between what we do and what we cause. Doing something that harms others
                    is inexcusable but doing something that causes harm to others , if motivated by the greater good, is
                    excusable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In “Actions, Intentions, and Consequences: The Doctrine of Double Effect,” Warren S. Quinn outlines
                    this definition as well as providing examples, most of which relate to intense, dire circumstances
                    such as war and medical emergency, including what he calls the Strategic Bomber Case vs Terror
                    Bomber Case. In this example, a strategic bomber in a war destroys a key military target that will
                    decrease the enemy’s production capabilities. Unfortunately, several innocent civilians that live
                    nearby are killed in the blast. Quinn contrasts this example with that of the terror bomber, who
                    attacks the same location, but with the intent of killing civilians to weaken the enemy’s morale.
                    Intuitively, we view the morality of both of these actions differently, and the DDE reflects that
                    difference. For the terror bomber, the harm is necessary to the success of the action, but for the
                    strategic bomber it is an unfortunate but unintended consequence and is therefore excusable. <a

                <p>
                    Although Quinn’s examples are helpful in understanding the DDE, I believe that they incorrectly
                    present the DDE as a framework of moral judgement that is restricted only to extreme cases in which
                    human life is on the line. I would like to propose an original example, one that illustrates that to
                    the DDE is relevant to choices present in everyday life. This pair of
                    cases may have been experienced by several of us in our youth, a set of cases I will call Gossiping
                    Tweens:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <italic>
                        Becky: Becky tells Amanda that Brayden has been saying things about her behind her back. Becky
                        knows
                        that Amanda will be angry and it is likely that a conflict will start, but she thinks that
                        Amanda
                        has the right to know what is being said about her. As expected, Amanda is furious and rushes to
                        confront Brayden.
                        <br>
                        Callie: Callie tells Amanda that Brayen has been saying things about her behind her back. Callie
                        knows Amanda will be angry and she really wants the drama of seeing a fight between Amanda and
                        Brayden.
                    </italic>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is readily apparent that both the Becky and Callie versions of the Gossiping Tweens case lead to
                    the same result–Amanda sparking a conflict with Brayden. However, the Doctrine of Double Effect
                    encourages us to morally appraise both versions differently. For Callie, the harm resulting from a
                    conflict between Amanda and Brayden is not an unfortunate side effect, it is the entire goal of her
                    choice. Alternatively, for Becky, truth is the goal and conflict is an unintended but expected
                    result. Even though both girls can accurately expect the harm that will result from their actions,
                    the Doctrine of Double Effect encourages us to view Callie’s choice as morally blameworthy, but not
                    Becky’s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would seem that the Doctrine of Double Effect is an intuitive and straightforward formula for
                    moral appraisal, but when we attempt to assess a new case, political assassination, it offers a
                    judgement that our intuitive moral compass likely deems disturbing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider a wartime predicament: members of a rebellion against a fascist regime know that
                    assassinating the dictator will create a better society. Unfortunately, they don’t have the ability
                    to get fighters close enough to kill him alone. Instead, their only feasible method of successful
                    assassination is bombing, which they are sure will also cost the lives of several unlucky citizens.
                    To put the situation in terms best suited for analysis by the Doctrine of Double Effect, the goal
                    is to create a better society, the method is the assassination of the dictator, and innocent lives
                    are an unwanted but certain consequence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, creating a better society is a morally praiseworthy goal and the DDE treats it as such.
                    However, it deems the action morally wrong because killing the dictator causes a death that is
                    necessary to the completion of the goal. Yet, since the action is committed for the greater good, it
                    is not losing the innocent civilians that makes it morally wrong. This is directly opposite from our
                    intuition about what would make this action morally wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Intuitively, causing the death of several innocent civilians is morally reprehensible while killing
                    a single dictator is far less so and, in some circumstances, may even be considered a moral good.
                    So, how can it be that, in a formula supposed to determine the morality of an action, the
                    assassination of the dictator holds moral weight while the death of the civilians holds none?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Doctrine of Double Effect excuses the unintended death of innocents but condemns the purposeful
                    assassinations, regardless of potential positive impacts their death could
                    have on the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is incredibly difficult to formulate a rule for moral appraisal that is immune to pitfalls such
                    as these and fits our instinctual perceptions of what is right and wrong. Even the Doctrine of
                    Double Effect, which at first glance seems to be a promising solution, can give moral verdicts that
                    are disturbing to our instincts. Ultimately, the work towards a foolproof moral framework continues
                    and the Doctrine of Double Effect is a promising stepping stone towards it.
