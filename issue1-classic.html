                    Imagine you could live your life experiencing the
                    greatest pleasures of the world. All your dreams and
                    greatest desires would come true, whether it's
                    making groundbreaking scientific discoveries or
                    becoming a world-renowned politician. The
                    imaginations are endless. This is what Robert
                    Nozick's experience machine offers: a chance to live
                    your greatest, most pleasurable life. But what of
                    reality? But would you choose this reality? More
                    importantly, what does your answer reveal about
                    how committed you truly are to reality?
                    <br><br>
                    In Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974), Nozick
                    introduces this thought experiment to counter
                    hedonism. Hedonism is the philosophical view that prioritizes pleasure and avoids pain,
                    claiming that humans are motivated to seek pleasure over pain. In his thought experiment, he
                    poses the question: would you plug into this machine for the rest of your life, knowing you
                    would experience the maximum amount of pleasure your life could bring you? ... <a class="textLink"

                    Each day of our lives, we are required to weigh
                    the good and bad of our choices and make the
                    decision we choose as best. Oftentimes, we don't
                    judge the morality of our actions based on any
                    particular framework, but rather use our intuitive
                    judgements to the best of our ability. The task of
                    moral philosophers is to create a framework that
                    aligns with our intuitive judgements that will allow us
                    to retrospectively or proactively gauge the morality
                    of a particular action. Several of these moral
                    frameworks focus on the balance of good and bad in
                    the result of a particular action to determine moral
                    praiseworthy or blameworthiness of the action, a
                    view known as consequentialism. While this may seem like a comprehensive system at first glance,
                    it fails to account for another facet of actions that we intuitively know holds moral weight:
                    intentions. We would not hold the person who engages in a morally blameworthy action while under
                    threat of physical harm to the same standard as someone who committed an identical action completely
                    of their own volition, even though the outcomes are the same. ... <a class="textLink"

                    In the 1981 post-structuralist book Simulacra and Simulation, Jean Baudrillard puts forward his
                    theory that signs have come to constitute and replace reality. The term ‘simulacra’ (plural:
                    simulacrum) refers to representations and copies that have either come to replace reality itself, or
                    never had originals. ‘Simulation’ simply refers to something which emulates real life. Baudrillard
                    proposes his theory of the four stages of simulacra which mark a degradation of reality:
                    <br><br>
                    1 It is the reflection of a basic reality.
                    <br>
                    2 It masks and perverts a basic reality.
                    <br>
                    3 It masks the absence of a basic reality.
                    <br>
                    4 It bears no relation to any reality whatever: it is its own pure simulacrum.
                    <br><br>
                    The first two stages are easily identifiable in the real world — they are exemplified by photographs
                    and simple photoshop jobs.

                    The relationship between citizen and State is not one-sided. Individuals are shaped by the social
                    and political systems that they live in. Our society plays a large part in our desires, fears, and
                    conception of ourselves. Analogously, political systems seek to govern individuals. Therefore, in
                    seeking to justify a political system, a political philosophy must rely on a conception of human
                    nature.
                    <br><br>
                    The political system of the United States is liberal democracy. In fact, the United States was the
                    first nation founded with an explicitly liberal government. Liberalism is a political philosophy
                    that places individual rights and freedom above all else. Since the end of World War II, liberalism
                    has been the dominant political philosophy of Western nations. Recently, however, liberalism in the
                    United States and across the globe has been failing. We are experiencing widespread discontent with
                    public institutions and the rise of populism and authoritarianism. In this context, liberalism can
                    be questioned and criticized from many directions.

                    No one familiar with the history of "Weird Fiction" can say that the books of the genre have as
                    important of a role in our lives as they did at the end of the 19th century. Back in the good old
                    days when death by Polio was a common occurrence and the world was getting ready for the World
                    War(s), the Gothic tradition matured into what we call today the genre of horror. It was writers
                    such as Edgar Allan Poe, E.T.A Hoffman and their sometimes gruesome or dreadful other times thought
                    provoking stories which shaped what we call today as fiction in general. Nevertheless, those days
                    are long past. Apart from the rare sighting of a horror geek (such as myself) one would rarely see
                    anyone interested in "Weird fiction" or be aware of the writings of the controversial Lovecraft or
                    the underappreciated Ramsey Campbell. The inability of this once significant genre to find a place
                    as it once did in our media intake signifies a great change in what we want to consume in general.
                    In order to understand how this occurred I plan on looking at the difference between the works of
                    Lovecraft (one of the most prominent Weird fiction writers of all time according to the acclaimed
                    book critique S.T. Joshi) and one of the most important television shows of our time: HBO's
                    Chernobyl. ... <a class="textLink" href="./our_obsession_i1a5.html" target="_blank">READ MORE</a>
