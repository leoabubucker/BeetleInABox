                <p>

                    Imagine you could live your life experiencing the greatest pleasures of the world. All your dreams
                    and greatest desires would come true, whether it's making groundbreaking scientific discoveries or
                    becoming a
                    world-renowned politician. The imaginations are endless. This is what Robert Nozick's experience
                    machine offers: a
                    chance to live your greatest, most pleasurable life. But what of reality? But would you choose this
                    reality? More
                    importantly, what does your answer reveal about how committed you truly are to reality?
                </p>
                <p>

                    In Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974), Nozick introduces this thought experiment to counter hedonism.
                    Hedonism is the philosophical view that prioritizes pleasure and avoids pain, claiming that humans
                    are motivated to seek pleasure over pain. In his thought experiment, he poses the question: would
                    you plug into
                    this machine for the rest of your life, knowing you would experience the maximum amount of pleasure
                    your life could
                    bring you? This pleasure would be the same as you would feel in the "real world," as if you had just
                    accomplished something you worked hard for and have that great sense of pleasure within you.
                    Additionally, upon entering
                    the machine, you will have no recollection of doing so. None of your pleasurable experiences will be
                    ruined by the
                    memory that you are now plugged into the machine. However, Nozick argues that many would not opt
                    into the experience
                    machine. He claims that most would feel as though it was "fake", and their lives would be void of
                    other
                    factors. For example, let's say John's goal is to run a marathon. In the machine, they can feel the
                    triumph without any of
                    the effort, pain, or perseverance it would take in real life. The physical and mental challenges
                    will not always be
                    pleasurable either. Many would say that the process matters. The struggle itself gives meaning to
                    the success. It seems
                    as though most would prefer the ability to perform the actions, rather than simply experiencing it.
                    Many also
                    prefer personal development, free will, and relationships and connections with others rather than
                    simply
                    experiencing them.
                </p>
                <p>

                    This reveals something profound: even though we say we value pleasure, we also seem deeply committed
                    to reality. Or are we? First, let's differentiate perception and reality. While perception is how
                    one
                    understands or interprets things or the world, reality is the way things exist in this world. For
                    example, Sam and
                    Nora are a married couple. Sam believes they are in a happy marriage, both true to their love for
                    one another.
                    Nora, however, is having an affair. Sam's perception is that he and Nora are in a truthful marriage.
                    The reality is
                    that they are not in a truthful marriage. Most argue that they are committed to the reality of the
                    world. They prefer to
                    live in the real world rather than be blindsided. In Sam's case, many would want to know that their
                    spouse is
                    cheating on them. Yet, I believe that when it comes to most situations, faced with real decisions,
                    most do not follow
                    this commitment to reality. Let's take veganism and animal cruelty, for example. Many agree that
                    animal cruelty is
                    immoral and that we should not mistreat and abuse animals. They know animals suffer in factory farms
                    or are exploited
                    in the fashion industry. Yet only about 1% of the global population is vegan. If so many people are
                    aware
                    of this reality, why don't they act on it? Because facing the truth is inconvenient. Changing diets,
                    habits, or
                    wardrobes requires effort, discomfort, and sometimes social alienation.
                </p>
                <p>

                    In the case of the experience machine, Nozick suggests that most would not opt into the machine,
                    claiming that there are other factors,
                    rather than simply pleasure, that people value.
                    However, what if your position was reversed? Imagine you are told your current life is the one
                    being experienced in an experience machine, like the one described in Nozick’s thought
                    experiment. You do not know what lies beyond the world you are currently experiencing. You
                    also have no information on what is in the real world either. Additionally, if you choose to stay,
                    you will forget this encounter ever existed. Your current life would not be haunted by the fact
                    that you are currently living in an experience machine that has been and will continue to
                    stimulate all your experiences. Would you choose to leave? Most people probably wouldn’t. If
                    they are happy in their current lives—have meaningful relationships, stable routines, and
                    fulfilling goals—they may feel no need to risk that for an unknown “reality.” Once again, people
                    tend to favor comfort over truth, just as they do when ignoring animal cruelty or environmental
                    degradation.
                </p>
                <p>

                    That leaves the question of how committed are we to this notion of real. Can we truly say
                    that we are uncommitted to it if we do not choose to leave this experience machine that has
                    become our reality? Firstly, I believe people’s commitment to this notion of reality is dependent
                    on convenience to them. Many choose to ignore that many food or fashion brands practice
                    animal cruelty, simply because it is more convenient for them to enjoy those pleasures than face
                    what is going on. People may ignore the ethical problems behind their favorite brands simply
                    because everyone else does too. It feels socially acceptable. However, in the example with the
                    married couple, Sam might ignore Nora’s infidelity if no one else knows about it. But if the affair
                    becomes public and threatens his reputation, he might be more motivated to act. The social cost,
                    rather than a commitment to truth, pushes him to confront reality.
                </p>
                <p>

                    In the case of the experience machine, the idea that we would forget that we are told we
                    would be living in an experience machine is the same. Our lives would not be affected. We
                    would have no recollection that our lives are fake. We enjoy and are comfortable with our
                    established lives in the experience machine, so why would we leave? Only those with a deep
                    commitment to truth, dissatisfaction with their current life, or a strong moral compass might
                    choose to leave. But once again, the decision hinges on how it impacts them personally.
                </p>
                <p>

                    This preference for convenience shows up in our daily routines too. We’re drawn to
                    solutions that promise results with minimal effort: fad diets that require no exercise, AI tools
                like ChatGPT that deliver answers instantly, and productivity hacks that streamline work. This isn’t
                inherently bad. It reflects a desire for efficiency. But it also reveals how rarely we choose the
                difficult path, even if it’s more honest or real.
            </p>
                <p>

                    So, are we committed to reality? Only conditionally. Our desire for the truth is often
                    outweighed by the desire for ease, comfort, and familiarity. Whether it’s ignoring ethical
                    dilemmas or choosing simulated pleasures over real struggle, we often act in ways that favor
                    convenience over authenticity.
                </p>
                <p>

                    In the end, our answer to Nozick’s question, “Would you plug in?”, may say a lot about
                    hedonism. But flip the question. Would you unplug? This says more about us. Perhaps the real
                    question is: When faced with the choice between truth and comfort, which do you choose?
